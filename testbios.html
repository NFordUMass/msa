    Our entire club constitutes the most intellectual, devoted, and impressive students of the UMass student body. But they would all be nothing more than sheep without the phenomenal lions that make up the executive board.

                I am a senior Sport Management & OIM dual degree candidate with a minor in Mathematics from Nantucket, MA. Last summer I worked for the Boston Bruins as a Business Strategy Intern. College Football is my analytic specialty where I enjoy using college statistics to predict NFL success. Iâ€™m all Boston for sports teams and represent Wazzu proudly for CFB.

                I am currently a junior, majoring in Sport Management and working towards a certificate in data analytics from Auburn, MA. I serve as the statistics manager for the UMass Women's Lacrosse Team. My speciality lies in baseball and player evaluation. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to assume a leadership position within a Major League Baseball operations department.

                    I am a sophomore Computer Science and Math double major from Acton, MA.  After enduring soccer parents for six years as a referee throughout middle and high school, I am now an incoming intern at Oliver Wyman in Actuarial Consulting next summer.  I love distance running, making stir fries, reading nonfiction, and watching the Jets season crumble every year.
