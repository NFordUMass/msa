I am currently a junior, majoring in Sport Management and working towards a certificate in data analytics from Auburn, MA. I serve as the statistics manager for the UMass Women's Lacrosse Team. My speciality lies in baseball and player evaluation. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to assume a leadership position within a Major League Baseball operations department.
