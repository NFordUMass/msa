# Where to Start
It can be overwhelming.  <br>
Do I need coding skills?  <br>
Where do I get the data?  <br>
How do I analyze the data? <br>
How do I visualize it?  <br>
What does it all mean?

One piece of advice: Have fun!  <br>
Working with sports analytics is the perfect match of challenging technical skills and engaging content.
